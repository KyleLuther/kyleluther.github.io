Hi, I'm a fourth year physics PhD student at Princeton, advised by [Sebastian Seung](https://twitter.com/sebastianseung?lang=en){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and computational neuroscience.

I came to Princeton with no clear vision of what I wanted to do. I like math, physics, and computers, and had done some astrophysics research in undergrad which had all those good things so I figured I'd stick with astro and see where things went.

In my first semester of grad school, I watched the online CS231n deep learning lectures given by Andrej Karpathy at Stanford. I was blown away by some of the applications of deep learning. I immediately dropped my "true physics" researched switched my to deep learning. Fortunately I was able to join a really great lab.

Since then, I've worked on application-oriented "deep learning for computer vision" [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00100.pdf), theory-oriented "physics applied to deep learning" [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04942.pdf), and most recently I've been interested in "bio-inspired deep learning" [3](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~runzhey/demo/asilomar2019.pdf)
